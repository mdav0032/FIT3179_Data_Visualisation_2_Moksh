                This visualisation gives an insight into tourism in the world. It first presents how much 
                tourism traffic different continents and countries receive (starting with an overview then 
                diving deeper into arrivals and departures). It then explains how much profit countries actually 
                make from the tourism and what the most common tourist attractions in the world are. It then takes
                and even deeper look into tourism in specificially Australia, displaying the difference between 
                domestic and international tourism and the reasons why tourists travel. So, to learn more about 
                tourism, keep reading!
